<h1>My Learnings in 1st Quarter and 2nd Quarter</h1>
<h3>My learnings on the first quarters are about History of Computers and they seem to be alot. We also learned about 
Transmission Mission Media, and Network Overview. About them is also a Networking Device. An example of it is a bridge, router, gateway, modem, repeater and access point. Then when we reached to week 5, we started learning more about <i>HTML.</i> That's when we did our First Webpage, which is firstly complicated because we are still learning from it. We did the Changing Font Color, Size and Style and Background color in HTML and Insert image from a webpage, also created. From 2nd Quarter, we started to get better at it because we learned more about HTML. First, I remembered we reviewed all the lessons we learned from the 1st quarter and we created a webpage from it. Very slowly, we got better and better. We learned about The Styles, Symbols, Iframes, and the most hardest part, XHTML. XHTML was very hard because firstly it was strict, complicated, and more non forgiving. Luckily we didn't do anything hard on it. My very conclusion in this journey is that we still have fun even though we use computers alot, and programming helps us become more curious which makes us active in class. Our teacher is also very funny so we don't get bored and we still have time to rest our eyes even though we use computers as our learning guide. Which is not very common in our early grades because we are still free to go outside before COVID-19. This is a long but very fun journey, we can still make it longer. </h3>
