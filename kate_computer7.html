<h3>First of all, let's start with the meaning of the song. The song is about a dysfunctional relationship. The male vocals describe what happened in that relationship from his point of view. It started off well, with the woman very invested in him. However, he was not fulfilled by her. Even though he was unhappy, he remained in the relationship because he was "addicted to a certain kind of sadness" and was resigned to it. In the end, he was dumped by the woman, who took steps to completely remove him from her life, including changing her number and having her friends get her things from his apartment. She did these things even though she had said that they would remain friends. Although he was happy that the bad relationship was over, he is hurt by the fact that she now treats him like a stranger without any regard for what they used to have.

The female vocals then describe the same relationship from her point of view. In her eyes, the relationship was also dysfunctional; he had been somewhat verbally abusive by always blaming her for every problem they had. In addition, he had been hung up on another woman. He had promised that he had gotten over it when in reality he had not. The singer eventually tires of this situation, finding it frustrating and hurtful, and ends the relationship by cutting him off entirely.

The video symbolizes the story with the paint - Gotye starts off as his current self, reminiscing. As he mentally enters his memories of the old relationship, the paint and lines slowly cover his entire body. Kimbra comes in fully painted (except for her face, which I admit doesn't really fit with my interpretation), indicating that at this point in the song, she is in the relationship with him. She moves closer to him as she breaks up with him, then moves away as she cuts him off. The paint is removed from her body as she moves on with her life. However, Gotye has not yet moved on, so he remains painted.</h3>

<h3>I like this song because the song is very mood changing. It starts off with a very jumpy tone and my music taste is really disorganized, some songs I really just like for the sake of it, or because I’ve heard that song so much. All i know, is this song is very calming and moody. At the same time, it's very jumpy and it sounds good. I like other songs too, but most of which were shown to me by people I like. I think what happens is that, since I like that person I associate this song with them, I ended up liking this song. There's many many songs i can choose but why this? because I express my feelings through words, and for me, music is a form that is more raw, more sensational. For me, whenever I listen to this song, it makes me focus on what i am doing and it is a very stress relief song. I don't get bored or get tired to this song, even though it is an old song from about 10 years ago, it's very good. But here’s the thing about me: I can be perfectly content to listen to a song for months at a time until I’ve worn it out, like one wears their favourite nightshirt.</h3>
