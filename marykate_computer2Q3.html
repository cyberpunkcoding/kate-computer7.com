<h1>Me, myself and I in 2022</h1>

<h3>I think me in 2022 is more compassionate, more confident, more independent, and hopefully more better. I just thought that i can really put myself in a better position like the others too. I enjoy myself sometimes by playing the <b>piano.</b> It really insipired me to be independent myself, i really like instruments including the piano. I play it when i have free time, i want to get better and i self-teach sometimes. That's my new rule for 2022, i don't like asking things from others anymore even though it's hard, i can still manage. But of course i don't wanna be selfish to others, i just want to be more independent and be more confident in myself. I don't consider myself as better, but as of today, i appreciate myself better. My family inspires me too, i want to take responsibility in them and help them.</h3>
